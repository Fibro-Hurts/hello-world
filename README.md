# hello-world
My very first repository.
My name is Kevin. I am just starting out in the programming and web-development area of computer science!
I am 47 years old and I have a chronic condition called FIBROMYALGIA, and it does HURT quite bit.
This is why I can only learn part time - when I am NOT hurting! ðŸ˜œ
